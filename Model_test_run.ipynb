They would then draft a new policy using the policy template located on ourResources page, and submit it to the University Policy Office via email atpolicy@unt.edu. A quick way to distinguish a policy from a procedure is that a policy states \\u201cWhy\\u201d the institution takes certian positions on an issue, and a procedure outlines \\u201cHow\\u201d the institution will implement this policy position. For a more detailed break-down of the difference, please check out ourPolicies v. Procedures Comparison Tablepage. If a change request is minor, such as a change in policy contact information or policy owner or contact, this can take a few business days. However, for substantive changes to the policy itself, the UNTPolicy Processesinvolve six steps of thorough review.  They are a collaborative effort of Vice Presidents, the Office of General Counsel, and stakeholders. A typical review cycle for an uncomplicated policy action, e.g., a deletion or review without revision, may take twelve (12) weeks or more. The more complex the action, the longer the process will take. Occasionally, there might be an accreditation, system, state, or federal deadline by which a policy action must be complete. In that case, the UPO will communicate the need for urgency to all parties involved, and request expedited review to meet the required timeline. The UPO will review and provide feedback or edits, if necessary. We will then initiate the routing process after confirming the policy draft meets prescribed standards and addressing any feedback concerns with the owner. Our processes are outlined in more detail in ourPolicy Processespage. The best person to address your questions pertaining to policy content is the Policy Contact listed on the policy's web page.  This page can be found by browsing or searching thePolicy Manualfor the policy-at-issue, and selecting the policy from the list. UPO works closely with the Records Management Program and the University Archives to maintain the older versions of UNT policies. The University Archives should be your first stop as you look for older versions of the policy. If for some reason the University Archives cannot produce the requested materials, please contact UPO staff atpolicy@unt.edu, and we will check our internal records in order to accommodate your request. The purpose of the legal review is to analyze policies to determine consistency with applicable law, identify and address legal risks, and improve legal defensibility.  The UNT Office of General Counsel (OGC) conducts legal sufficiency reviews for all UNT policies.  Please refer to the OGC Legal Sufficiency Review Guide on ourResources pagefor more information on the requirements and steps of the process. A \\\"substantive change\\\" is a change to the policy draft document contents that affects the substance of the policy in a way that modifies meaning and interpretation of the policy. Examples of a substantive change include, but are not limited to: addition or deletion of a definition, change in a responsible party, change in applicability of policy, and a revision of text in the policy body which alters the scope of it applicability.  A \\\"non-substantive change\\\" is a change to the policy draft document contents that does not affect the meaning and interpretation of the policy.  Examples of non-substantive changes include, but are not limited to: font and paragraph adjustments, page numbering, and policy number change. Each policy contains the initial approval date and revision history at the bottom of the document. If you would like to learn about recent policy updates, you may also go to thePolicy Updates page. There, you will find a list of all the recent policies changes. In order to ensure proper updating of policies, and consistency in presentation, only one version of a University-wide policy may exist.

It would also be beneficial totake a tourof the College of Engineering and view the labs in each of the different departments. If you have specific questions about different departments, you can schedule appointments with the faculty advisors. Generally speaking, engineering is more focused on theory and design; engineering technology is more focused on using theories and designs. Engineering often involves more advanced science and math requirements than engineering technology. Engineers often spend most of their time planning and designing, while engineering technologists spend most of their time carrying out the plans of engineers. You can find more information by reading ourdegree programdescriptions. Computer science deals with software and programming; computer engineering deals more with hardware and design. Information technology deals with designing and managing networks, databases, and other information technologies. You can find more information by reading ourdegree programdescriptions. The degrees offered by the UNT College of Engineering are designed to give flexibility in the Engineering Career Paths you choose. If you are interested in a specific Engineering field, it is recommended you contact Engineering Advising Office at 940-565-4201 orEngineering.Advisor@unt.eduto begin the conversation of how you can get on the right career path. You are trying to register for a course for which you have not met a prerequisite. To find out the prerequisites for courses, you will need to consult thecourse descriptionssection of the catalog. Please note that if you are a transfer student and have credit for the prerequisite from another institution, you may need to talk to the department that teaches the course to be added into the class. You need to contact the department that teaches the course for help registering for your lab and recitation. Example: If you are trying to register for CHEM 1410/30 recitations and are having difficulties, you need to contact the chemistry department. No, but students may choose to add a minor in a field of interest or to enhance their resumes. Please refer toTransfer Guides Talk to your instructor about getting an incomplete. Please be aware that if your instructor agrees to give you an incomplete and you do not complete the stipulated work within a year or earlier time specified by the instructor, the grade of \\u201cI\\u201d will default to the automatic grade designated by the instructor, or, if no automatic grade is designated, a grade of \\u201cF.\\u201d Please keep in touch with instructors who have given you an \\u201cI\\u201d to prevent this from happening to you!

    "    \"UNT-StudentAffairs\":\" It is up to the individual student to discuss with their professors prior to the religious Holy Day about missing class for that purpose. At the beginning of each semester, I would discuss with your professors the religious Holy Day that may interfere with your class attendance and make arrangements accordingly. Students are expected to attend classes regularly and to abide by the attendance policy established by the professor. However, the university is aware that there will be times when a student is unable to attend class due to emergency situations, health, or the death of a loved one. The Dean of Students Office is also available to assist you with documenting your absence. Students must provide the Dean of Students with official and verifiable documentation related to the reason for absence. Once the absences have been verified the decision to allow a student to make up course work is left to the discretion of the professor and or the department. You will need to come to the Dean of Students Office in the University Union, Suite 409 with documentation. We accept the obituary from the newspaper (with student\\u2019s name listed as a relative), a letter from the funeral home on their letterhead, or a program from the funeral service which would list the student\\u2019s name as a relative. After you bring this documentation to our office and talk with one of our staff members we can proceed with sending a notification to your professors that verify this absence. Please stop by the Dean of Students Office in the University Union, Suite 409 for assistance. The best way to receive this information as soon as the decision to close the university is made is by being registered with your most updated information (phone numbers and emails) in the UNT Eagle Alert system. You can register your information atmy.unt.edu. The Dean of Students Office is here to help! We can help you navigate through the proper procedures. Please stop by our office or send an email todeanofstudents@unt.edu There are a few places you can go\\u2026 First, if it is an issue concerning another student\\u2019s behavior with you, please stop by the Dean of Students Office in the University Union, Suite 409.

    "    \"UNT-library\":\" The homepage for the Portal is located at:https://texashistory.unt.edu For information about finding items in the Portal, please see theHelppages including theseHelp Guidesand PortalFAQs. Every month we average 115,000 unique visitors and almost 4 million hits\\nincluding people from all 50 states and more than 100 foreign countries. Becoming a Partner Institution No. We currently work with libraries of all types, as well as museums,\\nhistorical societies, archives, and other groups that have Texas\\nheritage materials. We also work with private or family collectors. Feasibility and Funding Yes. Here is a general list of items that we will not scan\\n(non-exhaustive): photocopiesframed photographs/artwork (unless they are removed from the frame\\nfor digitization)items that cannot be removed from plastic sleevesbooks that do not have large enough margins at the spine (unless the\\npages can bedisbound)texts (including newspaper issues or clippings) that are under\\ncopyright (unless your institution holds the rights to the items or\\ncan obtain permissions)items deemed too fragile to handle by Digital Projects staff There are also items that we will digitize under some circumstances, but\\nthat need prior approval, including: books with fold-out pagesitems bound together that will be separate items online (e.g.\\nscrapbooks) Since every project is unique, we prefer to estimate costs based on\\nspecific items. If you would like information about the cost to digitize\\nitems in your collection, pleasecontact us. We do occasionally scan copyrighted materials, however, copyright\\npermissions must be obtained. As part of the partnership agreement, the\\npartner institution assumes responsibility for determining whether or\\nnot something is under copyright protection and gaining any necessary\\npermissions to digitize and make the items publicly available. For more\\ninformation about copyright laws and determining the copyright of\\nparticular items, you may findthis pagehelpful. No. The Portal to Texas History is meant to be a way of making Texas\\nhistory more accessible to the public for scholarly and educational\\npurposes, so we have chosen to only digitize items that are intended for\\npublic use. This is also the reason that we will only digitize items\\nthat are in the public domain or copyrighted objects for which\\npermissions have been obtained. We consider large-format items to be anything larger than 12 x 17\\ninches. Although we have equipment for digitizing large-format objects,\\nwe are starting work on a long-term grant project to digitize maps and\\nare not currently accepting additional projects that cannot be scanned\\non our flatbed or planetary scanners. No. We currently do not accept projects from partner institutions unless\\nthe items are related to Texas history. No. The grant is not a monetary award. The grant covers all related\\nexpenses to digitize a collection including: creating a master-quality image or digital file for preservationcreating derivative versions of the image for online viewingcreating a thorough metadata record to describe each itemrunning printed materials (such as books and broadsides) through\\nOptical Character Recognition (OCR) software to automatically\\nextract the text to enable full-text searchingproviding you with master digital copies of your scanned materialsdigitally preserving the image or digital file in our dark archive -\\nwe are committed to preserving these digital images for the future,\\nand we are participating in federal research on digital preservation If you receive a \\u201cmini-grant\\u201d from UNT, shipping costs are not covered.\\nIf you seek an outside grant, shipping costs will only be covered if\\nthey are written in as part of the project cost. Preparing and Packing Your Items Although unique identifiers may contain letters (e.g. bu023), we prefer\\nthat they be primarily for identification rather than description. One\\nmain reason that we want items to have identifiers is so that we can\\neasily track items through the digitization process; if items do not all\\nhave a standardized set of identifiers, it is difficult to keep digital\\nfiles in order or match them to the physical items if we need a\\ncomparison. If you are assigning new identifiers, the best solution is\\ngenerally to keep an institutional list of the identifiers and a title\\nor keywords associated with each one if you need a way to identify them\\nlater. For more information, see ourAbout Unique Identifierspage. We created packing lists because checking items into the Digital\\nProjects Lab is more efficient and accurate if we have the same\\ninformation in the same format from every contributor. If your\\ninstitution has a standardized packing list, you can use that instead,\\nbut please be sure to send both a shipping list and an itemized list so\\nthat we can easily account for all of your items. We prefer that you use\\nour shipping list (even if you have an institutional form for the\\nitemized list) because we have included \\u201cinventory\\u201d notes on our form to\\ntrack items as they enter and leave the Lab. For clarification, see our\\npacking lists, which can be found on ourForms for Portal Partnerspage. An itemized list lets us make sure that we have an accurate accounting\\nof the items in the Digital Projects Lab and it lets us more easily\\ncommunicate with you if we find any discrepancies. If you are sending a large number of items, you can list them as ranges\\nof titles or identifiers, rather than individually. The list does need\\nto be clear, however, so if your numbering system is complicated please\\nmake sure that we will be able to easily check off all of the items. For\\nexample, if you have the range 1-16 but there is a number 13a, it would\\nbe better to list 1-13, 13a, 14-16. To view example packing lists, see\\nour packing lists, which can be found on ourForms for Portal\\nPartnerspage. Having items in order makes it easier to inventory the items when they\\narrive so that we can ensure that there are no discrepancies more\\nquickly and accurately. Some partners choose to drive to Denton with the items while others\\ndecide to mail or ship the items with insurance to cover the value. You\\nare responsible for delivering the materials to the Digital Projects Lab\\nand for picking them up unless they were shipped. What Happens to Your Items in the Lab It depends. First, the number and kinds of items will affect the length\\nof time it will take (for examples, books take much longer than\\nphotographs to scan and process). Secondly, we may not start your\\nproject immediately depending on the queue of items already in the lab\\nand the time of year (many of our students leave over the summer). Since\\nthere are so many variations, we will give you an estimate before we\\nstart your project that will take everything into account. To get a\\ngeneral sense of how long it might take to digitize your collection,\\npleasecontact us. Not exactly. Once all of the items for a specific project or partner\\nhave been scanned, the images go through a \\u201cQC\\u201d (quality control)\\nprocess. Each image is checked to ensure that it meets our standards and\\nthat there were no problems during the initial scanning procedure. In\\nsome cases, items will need to be re-scanned, which is also why we do\\nnot return your items until the digital objects have been uploaded. If\\nwe are responsible for writing metadata records, a similar QC process is\\nused to check and edit metadata records. Depending on how many projects\\nwe have in the lab and how large your project is, the objects might be\\nin the \\u201cQC\\u201d phase of the process for a length of time. Scanning Items We often upload images that we have not scanned, however, the images\\nmust meet our minimumstandards. If you are interested in scanning\\nyour own items, you might also want to look at our pageAbout Scanning\\nYour Materialsfor more information. If you are unsure whether your images meet our requirements, pleasecontact usfor more information. If your imagesdomeet our requirements, we have two different partner\\nmodels that you can consider depending on your institution\\u2019s needs. For\\ninformation about determining the best fit, see:Portal Partnership\\nModels We have many different kinds of scanners that we use depending on the\\nkind of project. We can give you more information about how we would\\nscan specific items, or you can look at our full list of lab scannershere. Adding Metadata To maintain the consistency of the records in The Portal to Texas\\nHistory, we format all of the information in our records according to\\ntheUNT Libraries Metadata Input Guidelines. We do our best to include as much relevant information as possible,\\nhowever, we sometimes leave information out of our metadata records if\\nit is unclear whether the information is accurate or actually pertains\\nto the specific item. There are also copyright issues involved in using\\nsome information (for example, including related newspaper articles from\\nmodern newspapers). Often we try to include information in non-visible\\nfields so that it is still connected to the item when the owner of the\\nitems looks at the records from the editing system. If you have\\nadditional questions about why specific information was omitted from\\nrecords, pleasecontact us. After we upload your items to the Portal, you will be given access to\\nthe online editing system so that you can complete the metadata record\\nfor each individual item via the Web. We will also give you a brief\\noverview of the way that our system works before you start adding\\nmetadata. To see instructions and screenshots of the system, look at ourCreating Metadatapage; for additional information, pleasecontact\\nus. Possibly. In the past, we have occasionally imported records from Excel\\nspreadsheets but we have not yet imported records from ContentDM. The\\nmain issue with importing records from another database is the degree to\\nwhich the fields you have used will easily map to the fields that we use\\nin the Portal; this also means that your fields must be used\\nconsistently throughout your spreadsheet or database for migration to\\nwork well. If you would like more information about whether or not\\nimporting records for your collection would work, pleasecontact\\nus. If you would like to see a list of the fields that we use in the\\nPortal and how they function, see ourUNT Libraries Metadata Input\\nGuidelines. What Happens After Items are Uploaded To create editing accountscontact uswith the names, e-mail\\naddresses, and preferred password(s) of the editors at your institution.\\nWe encourage editors at the same institution to use the same password so\\nthat it is less likely to be lost or forgotten. Lost passwords cannot\\ncurrently be retrieved, but they can be reset when necessary. A copy of the master digital files is created when we finish the project\\nand included with your items when we return them. If the total file\\nspace is under or near 15 GB, we will burn the digital files to DVDs; if\\nthe total file space is going to be more than 15 GB, we will ask you to\\nprovide a USB-compatible hard drive or thumb drive to hold the files.\\nKeep in mind that DVDs are for temporary storage and you will need to\\nfind a way to keep your own copy safe. Once we put items into the system, they are archived on our servers for\\npermanent storage. It is possible to retrieve copies, but every file has\\nto be recalled individually which means that the process to recover\\nentire collections is very time consuming and usually takes priority\\nafter current projects. If you need a new copy of the master digital\\nfiles for your items, pleasecontact us. There may be a fee to\\ncover retrieval costs. Terminology and Miscellaneous Questions Digitization is the process of taking an \\u201canalog\\u201d item (a book,\\nphotograph, sound recording, art print, or another physical item or\\nmedium) and converting it into a digital form. For objects such as books\\nor photographs, this is done by using scanners to capture digital images\\nof the whole item or individual pages; special scanning equipment is\\nused for other kinds of items including sound or video recordings and\\nmicrofilm. The purpose of digitization is to create an archival copy\\nthat can be kept on a hard drive or other storage device, and also to\\nmake the items available for use on the Internet or to share them\\nwithout handling or transferring the original object. In some cases, we \\u201cdisbind\\u201d books which means that we remove the covers\\nand cut the spine so that the pages of the book are loose. We do this\\nfor two main reasons. First, it is much quicker and easier (and also\\nless expensive) to scan a book if the pages are loose since they can be\\nfed through aduplex scanner. Second, there are some books that are\\nbound too tightly to scan without disbinding them because the text runs\\ntoo close to the binding without leaving a large enough margin between\\nthe text and the spine. Metadata is information about an item including descriptive,\\nadministrative, and preservation information. Descriptive fields include\\nthe title, creator (if known), and a description of the object. On The\\nPortal, when you are looking at a page for an object, the section that\\nsays \\u201cAbout this [item]\\u201d is the metadata record created for the item.\\nFor a more detailed description of what metadata is and how it works for\\npartners (with examples of records), see ourAbout Metadatapage.\\nFor information about UNT Libraries\\u2019 metadata standards, see our fullMetadata Input Guidelinesor the introductoryQuick-Start Metadata\\nGuide. Occasionally, the Digital Projects Unit receives grant money from\\ninstitutions to use for digitizing cultural objects. In order to draw a\\nvariety of unique objects into the Portal, we break grants into smaller\\nportions (\\u201cmini-grants\\u201d) that we allocate to other institutions for them\\nto have collections digitized and hosted on The Portal to Texas History.\\nSome mini-grants have specific themes (e.g. \\u201cTexas Cultures\\u201d) or\\nspecific item requirements and there is an application process for each\\ngrant series. Mini-grants can be particularly useful for institutions\\nthat want to see what digitization is like before starting their own\\nprojects or that don\\u2019t have the resources to do an entire digitization\\nproject independently. To see information about current or forthcoming\\nmini-grant opportunities, seeFunding Opportunities.\",\n",

TheAttendance tool in Canvasallows you to mark students as present, late, or absent from class! To access this, go toAttendance. The default setting in Canvas will not allow students to attach files in new discussion topics, discussion replies, and discussions within course groups. There are two places you can enable this setting: either through the \\\"Course Details\\\" tab inSettingsor through theDiscussionspage. Through Settings: Navigate to your course.From the Course Navigation Bar, clickSettings.Scroll down to the bottom of the \\\"Course Details\\\" tab.Click on \\\"More options.\\\"Check the box next to \\\"Let students attach files to discussions.\\\" Through Discussions: Navigate to your course.From the Course Navigation Bar, clickDiscussions.Click theSettingsicon.Check the box next to \\\"Attach files to discussions.\\\" \\u200bInstructors often assign a graded discussion based on student groups. When they grade these discussions in the SpeedGrader, the instructors expect to be able to view the specific posts made by individual students in the group. However, depending on how they set this option up, SpeedGrader will not accommodate this and instead will prompt instructors to view the entire discussion which makes grading very tedious. To ensure the graded discussion is set up correctly, follow these instructions: Create Groups \\u200b\\u200bFirst, you will need to establish groups in your course so you can assign discussions\\u00a0to those groups: \\u200bNavigate to your course.Click thePeopletab in the left-hand Course Navigation menu.In the top right-hand corner, click the green+Group Setbutton.Give the group set a name like \\\"Project Groups\\\" or Discussion Groups.\\\"Allow students to sign-up themselves by check-marking the box next to \\\"Allow self sign-up,\\\" allow Canvas to automatically split students into groups for you by selecting the first option under \\\"Group Structure\\\" and entering the number of groups, or manually create the groups.Click the greenSavebutton at the bottom of the window.Depending on the method, the groups will now be created under the \\\"Group Set\\\" tab you just created at the top of thePeople\\u200b page. Note:It is important that you create groups inside of the group set in Canvas. If you do not create groups within a group set, when you assign a discussion or assignment to a group, it will be assigned to students in the group set if they are not assigned to a group - which usually means all student. This will make it difficult to grade individual students. Now that you have created your groups, you can assign a group discussion: Navigate to your course.Click theDiscussionstab in the left-hand Course Navigation menu.\\u200bIn the top right-hand corner, click the green+Discussionbutton.Enter a topic title for the discussion as well as instructions.Select the various options based on your preferences.Checkmark the \\\"Graded\\\" option.A \\\"Group Discussion\\\" box will appear once the \\\"Graded\\\" option is check-marked. Checkmark the box next to \\\"This is a Group Discussion.\\\"Under the \\\"Group Set\\\" dropdown, select the name of the group set you created earlier.Assign the number of points possible and select whether to display the grade as points, percentage, etc. and choose which assignment group this discussion should be in.Click the graySave & Publish\\u200b button if you are ready to publish. Once students start to engage with the discussion, you can view each individual student's posts and comments when you access their name in SpeedGrader. A student may not be able to view a file you have uploaded to an assignment or module because the assignment or module are not published, the file itself is not published in theFileslink, the folder the file is in is not published, or it is possible that you have set the file to not be visible in student files. Check to make sure the green arrow appears next to the assignment or module, the file, and the file folder. Image 6 There are a couple of different ways to upload a file in a course and include it in an assignment. The recommended way utilizes the following instructions: Navigate to your course.From the Course Navigation Bar, clickAssignments.Create a new assignment by clicking the green+Assignmentbutton or edit an assignment you have already created by selecting the assignment name and then clicking the grayEditbutton.On the right-hand side, click the \\\"Files\\\" tab.Upload a new file by clicking on \\\"+Upload a new file\\\" or selecting a file you have already uploaded.If you uploaded a new file, make sure to select a folder to upload the file into then clickUpload.The file will be added in the Rich Text Editor of the assignment as a link.Click the greenSavebutton. This method is recommended as opposed to uploading a file and copying and pasting the file's URL in an assignment. When this method is used, if the course is then copied for a later semester, the file will not be able to be accessed since the file is not located in the new semester's Canvas course. Files can also be uploaded from theFileslink in Canvas and then selected from the \\\"Files\\\" tab of the Rich Content Editor when editing an assignment, quiz, etc. Note: Always make sure that the file and file folder you upload is published if you would like students to view it. Similar to Blackboard\\u2019s capability to weigh grades within the Grade Center, Canvas offers instructors a simple way to assign values to different assignment types within a course. To take advantage of this feature, follow the Canvas Community\\u2019sguide on weighting grades Weighted grades in Canvas do not occupy a second column; it modifies the total column. These weights can be removed at any time, and added back just as easily. Canvas Guides provides information on usingCanvas's SpeedGraderand how to useSpeedGrader's markup features. Yes,\\u00a0but it's not recommended. Depending on the class's overall score, curving grades may send scores down or up at various rates. Curved grades can only be reverted to previous scores byaccessing students' grade historiesand thenmanually editing gradesthat were curved. If you are interested in curving grades through Excel, you canexport gradesfrom your gradebook into Excel, change and/or curve\\u00a0them, and thenupload new\\u00a0scores. By default, students can see a high, low, and median score grade distribution for graded assignments with 5 or more submissions (pictured below). You can hide this feature from students by following these steps: Navigate to your course.From the Course Navigation Bar, clickSettings.Go to the \\\"Course Details\\\" tab.Scroll to the bottom and select \\\"more options.\\\"Check the box next to \\\"Hide grade distribution graphs from students\\\" (Image 7).Image 7ClickUpdate Course Detailsat the bottom of the page. Note:Instructors will still be able to view the grade distribution graphs after this option is disabled. Image 8 You have the ability to hide the \\\"Total\\\" column from students. To do this, follow the\\u00a0steps below: Navigate to your course.From the Course Navigation Bar, clickSettings.Click on \\\"Course Details\\\" tab at the top of the page.Scroll down to the bottom of this page. Click \\\"more options.\\\"Check the box for \\\"Hide totals in student grades summary\\\" (Image 8).Scroll to the bottom of the page again, and click the greenUpdate Course Detailsbutton. Note:If you hide this column, students will not be able to use the \\\"What If\\\" feature on their \\\"Grades\\\" page. This option allows students\\u00a0to explore what grades they need to earn in upcoming assignments and assessments in order to receive the total course grade they desire. To export and import grades from a course in Canvas, see the Canvas Community's guide onhow to download gradesandhow to upload grades. \\\"Treat Ungraded as 0\\\" is a visual change and does not affect any grades. This setting shows the change in Gradebook calculations if ungraded assignments were given scores of zero. Enabling this setting has no effect outside of the Gradebook;students cannot see any difference in their grade pages. When the \\\"Treat Ungraded as 0\\\" setting is enabled, assignments that do not have a grade will be treated as if a student received a score of zero. You can disable this setting in the Gradebook at any time. Even when this setting is enabled, Canvas will not populate zeros in the Gradebook. Dashes will still display for each student submission. This feature affects the configuration of the Total Column in the Gradebook, which also applies to CSV Exports. The CSV file displays columns for the Current and Final scores: the Current score reflects the total while ignoring unsubmitted assignments (option disabled), and the Final score counts unsubmitted assignments as zero (option enabled). Image 9 On the students' end, if an instructor chooses to \\\"Treat ungraded assignments as zero\\\" in a courses gradebook, students have to manually uncheck a box to not \\\"Calculate only based on graded assignments\\\" (Image 9) to see the same grade total in the course that the instructor sees (to be on the same page as the instructor concerning the grade they are earning in a course). The default on the student side is a check in the box regardless of the setting chosen by the instructor. If you have set up your assignments into groups and weighed them, you may have noticed that they appear as columns in the Gradebook. They have a dark blue shading to indicate that they cannot be deleted or hidden. In Canvas, you cannot add a letter grade to a student's assignment in the Gradebook. You must use the grading scheme which can then convert the grade to a letter according to the percentages and can be seen in the final grade column. If you are using a rubric to grade an assignment and you would like the points assigned to be calculated in the Gradebook, you will need to checkmark the option in the rubric when you are adding it to the assignment. To do this: Navigate to your course.From the Course Navigation Bar, clickAssignments.Click on the assignment you would like to add the rubric to.Click the gray+Rubricbutton.Create or find the appropriate rubric.Checkmark the box next to \\\"Use this rubric for assignment grading\\\" to ensure that whatever grade is calculated from the points in the rubric in SpeedGrader will automatically be inputted into the Gradebook.Click the greenCreate Rubricbutton. If you have already created or added the rubric to an assignment or discussion, you can edit the rubric by clicking the pencil icon that can be found in the top right of the rubric. Note:To add, view, and make changes to the rubric for discussion assignments, you will need to open the discussion assignment and click on the three vertical dots on the top right. In the dropdown, click \\\"Add Rubric\\\" if you have not already or \\\"Show Rubric\\\" if you already added one. When creating a page within Canvas, instructors have the option to open a page to be edited by students (see the Canvas Community's guide onhow to create a pageunder \\\"Edit Page Settings\\\"). Students can then treat the page like a Wiki, and any changes can be undone by an instructor through thepage history. To view the previous version of a page and/or revert the page back to the way it was in the past, follow instructions onhow to manage page history. To set up a quiz in Canvas that requires students to use LockDown Browser, follow these steps: Make sure the quiz has been deployed in the Canvas course.From the Course Navigation Bar, selectLockDown Browser.A list of quizzes in the course will be displayed. Quizzes labeled with \\u201cRequired\\u201d require students to use LockDown Browser. Quizzes labeled with \\u201cNot Required\\u201d do not require students to use LockDown Browser.To change the settings, click the arrow to the left of the quiz title and select the first option,Settings. From here you can either require or no longer require Lockdown Browser for your quiz.You may additionally require that LockDown Browser be used to view quiz feedback and results. Other options include creating an access code that students must enter to start the quiz. LockDown Browser will prompt students to enter the instructor-provided code before proceeding with the quiz. Yes. You can find this option in the SpeedGrader for the assignment. Image 10 When the Plagiarism Framework is enabled on an assignment and after a student has submitted the assignment, either a gray or colored icon will appear in the relevant box in the Gradebook (Image 10). The distinctions are as follows:Gray icon[1]: Similarity Report has not been generated yet.Color icon[2]: Similarity Report has returned a score; the color is based on the similarity percentage score:If the colored square for your Similarity Report isRed, 75% - 100% of the text in your paper matches something already in the Turnitin database.If the colored square isOrange, 50% - 74% of the text in your paper matches something already in the Turnitin database.If the colored square isYellow, 25% - 49% of your paper or assignment matches something already in the Turnitin database.If the colored square isGreenit means that 0% - 24% of your paper or assignment matches something already in the Turnitin database.And aBluecolored square means that less than 20 words in your paper or assignment matches something already in the Turnitin database.  You can find UNT specific basic Respondus documentationhereand on theCLEAR page for Respondus. LockDown Browser does not cache image or media files and, as a result, Canvas may have difficulty loading the quiz. This issue can be fixed by changing a setting in the Canvas quiz following these instructions: Navigate to the course.From the Course Navigation Bar, clickQuizzes.Open the relevant quiz.Click theEditbutton at the top right of the page.Make sure you are under theDetailstab.In the middle of the page, check-mark the box next to \\\"Show one question at a time.\\\"Click the greenSavebutton. This fix will make it easier for Canvas to load the quiz since questions will display one at a time. The problem can worsen if WiFi is being used due to limited bandwidth.\"\n",

    "    \"UNT-Policy_UPO\": 'Asix-year reviewof a policy is initiated by the University Policy Office and may lead to any three outcomes: review without revision, revision, or deletion.If you wish toamendan existing policy, the policy contact or owner may initiate a modification by submitting a request via email topolicy@unt.eduwith a draft of the policy document, with the proposed changes rendered in the document using the Track Changes feature in Word.  If you do not have a clean copy of the policy in Word format, please contact us atpolicy@unt.eduand we will be happy to provide one.If you wish tocreatea new policy, the responsible executive may identify a need, and then select a policy contact and owner.  They would then draft a new policy using the policy template located on ourResources page, and submit it to the University Policy Office via email atpolicy@unt.edu. A quick way to distinguish a policy from a procedure is that a policy states \\u201cWhy\\u201d the institution takes certian positions on an issue, and a procedure outlines \\u201cHow\\u201d the institution will implement this policy position. For a more detailed break-down of the difference, please check out ourPolicies v. Procedures Comparison Tablepage. If a change request is minor, such as a change in policy contact information or policy owner or contact, this can take a few business days. However, for substantive changes to the policy itself, the UNTPolicy Processesinvolve six steps of thorough review.  They are a collaborative effort of Vice Presidents, the Office of General Counsel, and stakeholders. A typical review cycle for an uncomplicated policy action, e.g., a deletion or review without revision, may take twelve (12) weeks or more. The more complex the action, the longer the process will take. Occasionally, there might be an accreditation, system, state, or federal deadline by which a policy action must be complete. In that case, the UPO will communicate the need for urgency to all parties involved, and request expedited review to meet the required timeline. The UPO will review and provide feedback or edits, if necessary. We will then initiate the routing process after confirming the policy draft meets prescribed standards and addressing any feedback concerns with the owner. Our processes are outlined in more detail in ourPolicy Processespage. The best person to address your questions pertaining to policy content is the Policy Contact listed on the policy\\'s web page.  This page can be found by browsing or searching thePolicy Manualfor the policy-at-issue, and selecting the policy from the list. UPO works closely with the Records Management Program and the University Archives to maintain the older versions of UNT policies. The University Archives should be your first stop as you look for older versions of the policy. If for some reason the University Archives cannot produce the requested materials, please contact UPO staff atpolicy@unt.edu, and we will check our internal records in order to accommodate your request. The purpose of the legal review is to analyze policies to determine consistency with applicable law, identify and address legal risks, and improve legal defensibility.  The UNT Office of General Counsel (OGC) conducts legal sufficiency reviews for all UNT policies.  Please refer to the OGC Legal Sufficiency Review Guide on ourResources pagefor more information on the requirements and steps of the process. A \"substantive change\" is a change to the policy draft document contents that affects the substance of the policy in a way that modifies meaning and interpretation of the policy. Examples of a substantive change include, but are not limited to: addition or deletion of a definition, change in a responsible party, change in applicability of policy, and a revision of text in the policy body which alters the scope of it applicability.  A \"non-substantive change\" is a change to the policy draft document contents that does not affect the meaning and interpretation of the policy.  Examples of non-substantive changes include, but are not limited to: font and paragraph adjustments, page numbering, and policy number change. Each policy contains the initial approval date and revision history at the bottom of the document. If you would like to learn about recent policy updates, you may also go to thePolicy Updates page. There, you will find a list of all the recent policies changes. In order to ensure proper updating of policies, and consistency in presentation, only one version of a University-wide policy may exist. That version resides within the University Policy Manual on the official policy page. If you would like to reference a UNT policy on your department\\u2019s web page, please link back to the policy that resides within the University Policy Manual on the official policy page.',\n",

A: Below are recommended steps to take during and after your advising appointment: Participate and be engaged in the advising process. Academic advising is a two-way street, and advisors need to know what your goals are to be able to point you in the right direction. Ask questions when you don\\u2019t understand. This is your opportunity to get answers to your academic questions and/or concerns. Take notes! Review the materials given to you and follow-up with recommended resources and actions suggested to you. Reach out to your academic advisor via email with any clarifying questions you might have after your appointment. Meet withspecialized advisorsas needed. A: Meet with your academic advisor every semester, and think about the recommendations below when coming up with options for your course schedule: Consider your obligations outside of school (work, practice schedules, etc.); don\\u2019t try to do too much. Think about the times of the day when you are most focused.\\u00a0 Can you avoid classes offered during times when you are less attentive or overly tired?

Talk to friends about instructors, course formats, and course content. They can be helpful\\u00a0sources \\u00a0of information. But remember:your friends won\\u2019t always like or dislike the style that works for you. Consider more than the title of a course. Read the course descriptions in theUNT Catalog.Always check prerequisites in the course description. Think about where classroom buildings are in relation to your other classes.

    "    \"UNT-StudentAffairs\": \" It is up to the individual student to discuss with their professors prior to the religious Holy Day about missing class for that purpose. At the beginning of each semester, I would discuss with your professors the religious Holy Day that may interfere with your class attendance and make arrangements accordingly. Students are expected to attend classes regularly and to abide by the attendance policy established by the professor. However, the university is aware that there will be times when a student is unable to attend class due to emergency situations, health, or the death of a loved one. The Dean of Students Office is also available to assist you with documenting your absence. Students must provide the Dean of Students with official and verifiable documentation related to the reason for absence. Once the absences have been verified the decision to allow a student to make up course work is left to the discretion of the professor and or the department. You will need to come to the Dean of Students Office in the University Union, Suite 409 with documentation. We accept the obituary from the newspaper (with student\\u2019s name listed as a relative), a letter from the funeral home on their letterhead, or a program from the funeral service which would list the student\\u2019s name as a relative.

    "    \"UNT-library\": \" The homepage for the Portal is located at:https://texashistory.unt.edu For information about finding items in the Portal, please see theHelppages including theseHelp Guidesand PortalFAQs. Every month we average 115,000 unique visitors and almost 4 million hits\\nincluding people from all 50 states and more than 100 foreign countries. Becoming a Partner Institution No. We currently work with libraries of all types, as well as museums,\\nhistorical societies, archives, and other groups that have Texas\\nheritage materials. We also work with private or family collectors. Feasibility and Funding Yes. Here is a general list of items that we will not scan\\n(non-exhaustive): photocopiesframed photographs/artwork (unless they are removed from the frame\\nfor digitization)items that cannot be removed from plastic sleevesbooks that do not have large enough margins at the spine (unless the\\npages can bedisbound)texts (including newspaper issues or clippings) that are under\\ncopyright (unless your institution holds the rights to the items or\\ncan obtain permissions)items deemed too fragile to handle by Digital Projects staff There are also items that we will digitize under some circumstances, but\\nthat need prior approval, including: books with fold-out pagesitems bound together that will be separate items online (e.g.\\nscrapbooks) Since every project is unique, we prefer to estimate costs based on\\nspecific items. If you would like information about the cost to digitize\\nitems in your collection, pleasecontact us. We do occasionally scan copyrighted materials, however, copyright\\npermissions must be obtained. As part of the partnership agreement, the\\npartner institution assumes responsibility for determining whether or\\nnot something is under copyright protection and gaining any necessary\\npermissions to digitize and make the items publicly available. For more\\ninformation about copyright laws and determining the copyright of\\nparticular items, you may findthis pagehelpful. No. The Portal to Texas History is meant to be a way of making Texas\\nhistory more accessible to the public for scholarly and educational\\npurposes, so we have chosen to only digitize items that are intended for\\npublic use. This is also the reason that we will only digitize items\\nthat are in the public domain or copyrighted objects for which\\npermissions have been obtained. We consider large-format items to be anything larger than 12 x 17\\ninches. Although we have equipment for digitizing large-format objects,\\nwe are starting work on a long-term grant project to digitize maps and\\nare not currently accepting additional projects that cannot be scanned\\non our flatbed or planetary scanners. No. We currently do not accept projects from partner institutions unless\\nthe items are related to Texas history. No. The grant is not a monetary award. The grant covers all related\\nexpenses to digitize a collection including: creating a master-quality image or digital file for preservationcreating derivative versions of the image for online viewingcreating a thorough metadata record to describe each itemrunning printed materials (such as books and broadsides) through\\nOptical Character Recognition (OCR) software to automatically\\nextract the text to enable full-text searchingproviding you with master digital copies of your scanned materialsdigitally preserving the image or digital file in our dark archive -\\nwe are committed to preserving these digital images for the future,\\nand we are participating in federal research on digital preservation If you receive a \\u201cmini-grant\\u201d from UNT, shipping costs are not covered.\\nIf you seek an outside grant, shipping costs will only be covered if\\nthey are written in as part of the project cost. Preparing and Packing Your Items Although unique identifiers may contain letters (e.g. bu023), we prefer\\nthat they be primarily for identification rather than description. One\\nmain reason that we want items to have identifiers is so that we can\\neasily track items through the digitization process; if items do not all\\nhave a standardized set of identifiers, it is difficult to keep digital\\nfiles in order or match them to the physical items if we need a\\ncomparison. If you are assigning new identifiers, the best solution is\\ngenerally to keep an institutional list of the identifiers and a title\\nor keywords associated with each one if you need a way to identify them\\nlater. For more information, see ourAbout Unique Identifierspage. We created packing lists because checking items into the Digital\\nProjects Lab is more efficient and accurate if we have the same\\ninformation in the same format from every contributor. If your\\ninstitution has a standardized packing list, you can use that instead,\\nbut please be sure to send both a shipping list and an itemized list so\\nthat we can easily account for all of your items. We prefer that you use\\nour shipping list (even if you have an institutional form for the\\nitemized list) because we have included \\u201cinventory\\u201d notes on our form to\\ntrack items as they enter and leave the Lab. For clarification, see our\\npacking lists, which can be found on ourForms for Portal Partnerspage. An itemized list lets us make sure that we have an accurate accounting\\nof the items in the Digital Projects Lab and it lets us more easily\\ncommunicate with you if we find any discrepancies. If you are sending a large number of items, you can list them as ranges\\nof titles or identifiers, rather than individually. The list does need\\nto be clear, however, so if your numbering system is complicated please\\nmake sure that we will be able to easily check off all of the items. For\\nexample, if you have the range 1-16 but there is a number 13a, it would\\nbe better to list 1-13, 13a, 14-16. To view example packing lists, see\\nour packing lists, which can be found on ourForms for Portal\\nPartnerspage. Having items in order makes it easier to inventory the items when they\\narrive so that we can ensure that there are no discrepancies more\\nquickly and accurately. Some partners choose to drive to Denton with the items while others\\ndecide to mail or ship the items with insurance to cover the value. You\\nare responsible for delivering the materials to the Digital Projects Lab\\nand for picking them up unless they were shipped. What Happens to Your Items in the Lab It depends. First, the number and kinds of items will affect the length\\nof time it will take (for examples, books take much longer than\\nphotographs to scan and process). Secondly, we may not start your\\nproject immediately depending on the queue of items already in the lab\\nand the time of year (many of our students leave over the summer). Since\\nthere are so many variations, we will give you an estimate before we\\nstart your project that will take everything into account. To get a\\ngeneral sense of how long it might take to digitize your collection,\\npleasecontact us. Not exactly. Once all of the items for a specific project or partner\\nhave been scanned, the images go through a \\u201cQC\\u201d (quality control)\\nprocess. Each image is checked to ensure that it meets our standards and\\nthat there were no problems during the initial scanning procedure. In\\nsome cases, items will need to be re-scanned, which is also why we do\\nnot return your items until the digital objects have been uploaded. If\\nwe are responsible for writing metadata records, a similar QC process is\\nused to check and edit metadata records. Depending on how many projects\\nwe have in the lab and how large your project is, the objects might be\\nin the \\u201cQC\\u201d phase of the process for a length of time. Scanning Items We often upload images that we have not scanned, however, the images\\nmust meet our minimumstandards. If you are interested in scanning\\nyour own items, you might also want to look at our pageAbout Scanning\\nYour Materialsfor more information. If you are unsure whether your images meet our requirements, pleasecontact usfor more information. If your imagesdomeet our requirements, we have two different partner\\nmodels that you can consider depending on your institution\\u2019s needs. For\\ninformation about determining the best fit, see:Portal Partnership\\nModels We have many different kinds of scanners that we use depending on the\\nkind of project. We can give you more information about how we would\\nscan specific items, or you can look at our full list of lab scannershere. Adding Metadata To maintain the consistency of the records in The Portal to Texas\\nHistory, we format all of the information in our records according to\\ntheUNT Libraries Metadata Input Guidelines. We do our best to include as much relevant information as possible,\\nhowever, we sometimes leave information out of our metadata records if\\nit is unclear whether the information is accurate or actually pertains\\nto the specific item. There are also copyright issues involved in using\\nsome information (for example, including related newspaper articles from\\nmodern newspapers). Often we try to include information in non-visible\\nfields so that it is still connected to the item when the owner of the\\nitems looks at the records from the editing system. If you have\\nadditional questions about why specific information was omitted from\\nrecords, pleasecontact us. After we upload your items to the Portal, you will be given access to\\nthe online editing system so that you can complete the metadata record\\nfor each individual item via the Web. We will also give you a brief\\noverview of the way that our system works before you start adding\\nmetadata. To see instructions and screenshots of the system, look at ourCreating Metadatapage; for additional information, pleasecontact\\nus. Possibly. In the past, we have occasionally imported records from Excel\\nspreadsheets but we have not yet imported records from ContentDM. The\\nmain issue with importing records from another database is the degree to\\nwhich the fields you have used will easily map to the fields that we use\\nin the Portal; this also means that your fields must be used\\nconsistently throughout your spreadsheet or database for migration to\\nwork well. If you would like more information about whether or not\\nimporting records for your collection would work, pleasecontact\\nus. If you would like to see a list of the fields that we use in the\\nPortal and how they function, see ourUNT Libraries Metadata Input\\nGuidelines. What Happens After Items are Uploaded To create editing accountscontact uswith the names, e-mail\\naddresses, and preferred password(s) of the editors at your institution.\\nWe encourage editors at the same institution to use the same password so\\nthat it is less likely to be lost or forgotten. Lost passwords cannot\\ncurrently be retrieved, but they can be reset when necessary. A copy of the master digital files is created when we finish the project\\nand included with your items when we return them. If the total file\\nspace is under or near 15 GB, we will burn the digital files to DVDs; if\\nthe total file space is going to be more than 15 GB, we will ask you to\\nprovide a USB-compatible hard drive or thumb drive to hold the files.\\nKeep in mind that DVDs are for temporary storage and you will need to\\nfind a way to keep your own copy safe. Once we put items into the system, they are archived on our servers for\\npermanent storage. It is possible to retrieve copies, but every file has\\nto be recalled individually which means that the process to recover\\nentire collections is very time consuming and usually takes priority\\nafter current projects. If you need a new copy of the master digital\\nfiles for your items, pleasecontact us. There may be a fee to\\ncover retrieval costs. Terminology and Miscellaneous Questions Digitization is the process of taking an \\u201canalog\\u201d item (a book,\\nphotograph, sound recording, art print, or another physical item or\\nmedium) and converting it into a digital form. For objects such as books\\nor photographs, this is done by using scanners to capture digital images\\nof the whole item or individual pages; special scanning equipment is\\nused for other kinds of items including sound or video recordings and\\nmicrofilm. The purpose of digitization is to create an archival copy\\nthat can be kept on a hard drive or other storage device, and also to\\nmake the items available for use on the Internet or to share them\\nwithout handling or transferring the original object. In some cases, we \\u201cdisbind\\u201d books which means that we remove the covers\\nand cut the spine so that the pages of the book are loose. We do this\\nfor two main reasons. First, it is much quicker and easier (and also\\nless expensive) to scan a book if the pages are loose since they can be\\nfed through aduplex scanner. Second, there are some books that are\\nbound too tightly to scan without disbinding them because the text runs\\ntoo close to the binding without leaving a large enough margin between\\nthe text and the spine. Metadata is information about an item including descriptive,\\nadministrative, and preservation information. Descriptive fields include\\nthe title, creator (if known), and a description of the object. On The\\nPortal, when you are looking at a page for an object, the section that\\nsays \\u201cAbout this [item]\\u201d is the metadata record created for the item.\\nFor a more detailed description of what metadata is and how it works for\\npartners (with examples of records), see ourAbout Metadatapage.\\nFor information about UNT Libraries\\u2019 metadata standards, see our fullMetadata Input Guidelinesor the introductoryQuick-Start Metadata\\nGuide. Occasionally, the Digital Projects Unit receives grant money from\\ninstitutions to use for digitizing cultural objects. In order to draw a\\nvariety of unique objects into the Portal, we break grants into smaller\\nportions (\\u201cmini-grants\\u201d) that we allocate to other institutions for them\\nto have collections digitized and hosted on The Portal to Texas History.\\nSome mini-grants have specific themes (e.g. \\u201cTexas Cultures\\u201d) or\\nspecific item requirements and there is an application process for each\\ngrant series. Mini-grants can be particularly useful for institutions\\nthat want to see what digitization is like before starting their own\\nprojects or that don\\u2019t have the resources to do an entire digitization\\nproject independently. To see information about current or forthcoming\\nmini-grant opportunities, seeFunding Opportunities.\",\n",

TheAttendance tool in Canvasallows you to mark students as present, late, or absent from class! To access this, go toAttendance. The default setting in Canvas will not allow students to attach files in new discussion topics, discussion replies, and discussions within course groups. There are two places you can enable this setting: either through the \"Course Details\" tab inSettingsor through theDiscussionspage. Through Settings: Navigate to your course.From the Course Navigation Bar, clickSettings.Scroll down to the bottom of the \"Course Details\" tab.Click on \"More options.\"Check the box next to \"Let students attach files to discussions.\" Through Discussions: Navigate to your course.From the Course Navigation Bar, clickDiscussions.Click theSettingsicon.Check the box next to \"Attach files to discussions.\" Instructors often assign a graded discussion based on student groups. When they grade these discussions in the SpeedGrader, the instructors expect to be able to view the specific posts made by individual students in the group. However, depending on how they set this option up, SpeedGrader will not accommodate this and instead will prompt instructors to view the entire discussion which makes grading very tedious. To ensure the graded discussion is set up correctly, follow these instructions: Create Groups First, you will need to establish groups in your course so you can assign discussions\\u00a0to those groups: Navigate to your course.Click thePeopletab in the left-hand Course Navigation menu.In the top right-hand corner, click the green+Group Setbutton.Give the group set a name like \"Project Groups\" or Discussion Groups.\"Allow students to sign-up themselves by check-marking the box next to \"Allow self sign-up,\" allow Canvas to automatically split students into groups for you by selecting the first option under \"Group Structure\" and entering the number of groups, or manually create the groups.Click the greenSavebutton at the bottom of the window.Depending on the method, the groups will now be created under the \"Group Set\" tab you just created at the top of thePeople page. Note:It is important that you create groups inside of the group set in Canvas. If you do not create groups within a group set, when you assign a discussion or assignment to a group, it will be assigned to students in the group set if they are not assigned to a group - which usually means all student. This will make it difficult to grade individual students. Now that you have created your groups, you can assign a group discussion: Navigate to your course.Click theDiscussionstab in the left-hand Course Navigation menu.In the top right-hand corner, click the green+Discussionbutton.Enter a topic title for the discussion as well as instructions.Select the various options based on your preferences.Checkmark the \"Graded\" option.A \"Group Discussion\" box will appear once the \"Graded\" option is check-marked. Checkmark the box next to \"This is a Group Discussion.\"Under the \"Group Set\" dropdown, select the name of the group set you created earlier.Assign the number of points possible and select whether to display the grade as points, percentage, etc. and choose which assignment group this discussion should be in.Click the graySave & Publish button if you are ready to publish. Once students start to engage with the discussion, you can view each individual student\\'s posts and comments when you access their name in SpeedGrader. A student may not be able to view a file you have uploaded to an assignment or module because the assignment or module are not published, the file itself is not published in theFileslink, the folder the file is in is not published, or it is possible that you have set the file to not be visible in student files. Check to make sure the green arrow appears next to the assignment or module, the file, and the file folder. Image 6 There are a couple of different ways to upload a file in a course and include it in an assignment. The recommended way utilizes the following instructions: Navigate to your course.From the Course Navigation Bar, clickAssignments.Create a new assignment by clicking the green+Assignmentbutton or edit an assignment you have already created by selecting the assignment name and then clicking the grayEditbutton.On the right-hand side, click the \"Files\" tab.Upload a new file by clicking on \"+Upload a new file\" or selecting a file you have already uploaded.If you uploaded a new file, make sure to select a folder to upload the file into then clickUpload.The file will be added in the Rich Text Editor of the assignment as a link.Click the greenSavebutton. This method is recommended as opposed to uploading a file and copying and pasting the file\\'s URL in an assignment. When this method is used, if the course is then copied for a later semester, the file will not be able to be accessed since the file is not located in the new semester\\'s Canvas course. Files can also be uploaded from theFileslink in Canvas and then selected from the \"Files\" tab of the Rich Content Editor when editing an assignment, quiz, etc. Note: Always make sure that the file and file folder you upload is published if you would like students to view it. Similar to Blackboard\\u2019s capability to weigh grades within the Grade Center, Canvas offers instructors a simple way to assign values to different assignment types within a course. To take advantage of this feature, follow the Canvas Community\\u2019sguide on weighting grades Weighted grades in Canvas do not occupy a second column; it modifies the total column. These weights can be removed at any time, and added back just as easily. Canvas Guides provides information on usingCanvas\\'s SpeedGraderand how to useSpeedGrader\\'s markup features. Yes,\\u00a0but it\\'s not recommended. Depending on the class\\'s overall score, curving grades may send scores down or up at various rates. Curved grades can only be reverted to previous scores byaccessing students\\' grade historiesand thenmanually editing gradesthat were curved. If you are interested in curving grades through Excel, you canexport gradesfrom your gradebook into Excel, change and/or curve\\u00a0them, and thenupload new\\u00a0scores. By default, students can see a high, low, and median score grade distribution for graded assignments with 5 or more submissions (pictured below). You can hide this feature from students by following these steps: Navigate to your course.From the Course Navigation Bar, clickSettings.Go to the \"Course Details\" tab.Scroll to the bottom and select \"more options.\"Check the box next to \"Hide grade distribution graphs from students\" (Image 7).Image 7ClickUpdate Course Detailsat the bottom of the page. Note:Instructors will still be able to view the grade distribution graphs after this option is disabled. Image 8 You have the ability to hide the \"Total\" column from students. To do this, follow the\\u00a0steps below: Navigate to your course.From the Course Navigation Bar, clickSettings.Click on \"Course Details\" tab at the top of the page.Scroll down to the bottom of this page. Click \"more options.\"Check the box for \"Hide totals in student grades summary\" (Image 8).Scroll to the bottom of the page again, and click the greenUpdate Course Detailsbutton. Note:If you hide this column, students will not be able to use the \"What If\" feature on their \"Grades\" page. This option allows students\\u00a0to explore what grades they need to earn in upcoming assignments and assessments in order to receive the total course grade they desire. To export and import grades from a course in Canvas, see the Canvas Community\\'s guide onhow to download gradesandhow to upload grades. \"Treat Ungraded as 0\" is a visual change and does not affect any grades. This setting shows the change in Gradebook calculations if ungraded assignments were given scores of zero. Enabling this setting has no effect outside of the Gradebook;students cannot see any difference in their grade pages. When the \"Treat Ungraded as 0\" setting is enabled, assignments that do not have a grade will be treated as if a student received a score of zero. You can disable this setting in the Gradebook at any time. Even when this setting is enabled, Canvas will not populate zeros in the Gradebook. Dashes will still display for each student submission. This feature affects the configuration of the Total Column in the Gradebook, which also applies to CSV Exports. The CSV file displays columns for the Current and Final scores: the Current score reflects the total while ignoring unsubmitted assignments (option disabled), and the Final score counts unsubmitted assignments as zero (option enabled). Image 9 On the students\\' end, if an instructor chooses to \"Treat ungraded assignments as zero\" in a courses gradebook, students have to manually uncheck a box to not \"Calculate only based on graded assignments\" (Image 9) to see the same grade total in the course that the instructor sees (to be on the same page as the instructor concerning the grade they are earning in a course). The default on the student side is a check in the box regardless of the setting chosen by the instructor. If you have set up your assignments into groups and weighed them, you may have noticed that they appear as columns in the Gradebook. They have a dark blue shading to indicate that they cannot be deleted or hidden. In Canvas, you cannot add a letter grade to a student\\'s assignment in the Gradebook. You must use the grading scheme which can then convert the grade to a letter according to the percentages and can be seen in the final grade column. If you are using a rubric to grade an assignment and you would like the points assigned to be calculated in the Gradebook, you will need to checkmark the option in the rubric when you are adding it to the assignment. To do this: Navigate to your course.From the Course Navigation Bar, clickAssignments.Click on the assignment you would like to add the rubric to.Click the gray+Rubricbutton.Create or find the appropriate rubric.Checkmark the box next to \"Use this rubric for assignment grading\" to ensure that whatever grade is calculated from the points in the rubric in SpeedGrader will automatically be inputted into the Gradebook.Click the greenCreate Rubricbutton. If you have already created or added the rubric to an assignment or discussion, you can edit the rubric by clicking the pencil icon that can be found in the top right of the rubric. Note:To add, view, and make changes to the rubric for discussion assignments, you will need to open the discussion assignment and click on the three vertical dots on the top right. In the dropdown, click \"Add Rubric\" if you have not already or \"Show Rubric\" if you already added one. When creating a page within Canvas, instructors have the option to open a page to be edited by students (see the Canvas Community\\'s guide onhow to create a pageunder \"Edit Page Settings\"). Students can then treat the page like a Wiki, and any changes can be undone by an instructor through thepage history. To view the previous version of a page and/or revert the page back to the way it was in the past, follow instructions onhow to manage page history. To set up a quiz in Canvas that requires students to use LockDown Browser, follow these steps: Make sure the quiz has been deployed in the Canvas course.From the Course Navigation Bar, selectLockDown Browser.A list of quizzes in the course will be displayed. Quizzes labeled with \\u201cRequired\\u201d require students to use LockDown Browser. Quizzes labeled with \\u201cNot Required\\u201d do not require students to use LockDown Browser.To change the settings, click the arrow to the left of the quiz title and select the first option,Settings. From here you can either require or no longer require Lockdown Browser for your quiz.You may additionally require that LockDown Browser be used to view quiz feedback and results. Other options include creating an access code that students must enter to start the quiz. LockDown Browser will prompt students to enter the instructor-provided code before proceeding with the quiz. Yes. You can find this option in the SpeedGrader for the assignment. Image 10 When the Plagiarism Framework is enabled on an assignment and after a student has submitted the assignment, either a gray or colored icon will appear in the relevant box in the Gradebook (Image 10). The distinctions are as follows:Gray icon[1]: Similarity Report has not been generated yet.Color icon[2]: Similarity Report has returned a score; the color is based on the similarity percentage score:If the colored square for your Similarity Report isRed, 75% - 100% of the text in your paper matches something already in the Turnitin database.If the colored square isOrange, 50% - 74% of the text in your paper matches something already in the Turnitin database.If the colored square isYellow, 25% - 49% of your paper or assignment matches something already in the Turnitin database.If the colored square isGreenit means that 0% - 24% of your paper or assignment matches something already in the Turnitin database.And aBluecolored square means that less than 20 words in your paper or assignment matches something already in the Turnitin database.  You can find UNT specific basic Respondus documentationhereand on theCLEAR page for Respondus. LockDown Browser does not cache image or media files and, as a result, Canvas may have difficulty loading the quiz. This issue can be fixed by changing a setting in the Canvas quiz following these instructions: Navigate to the course.From the Course Navigation Bar, clickQuizzes.Open the relevant quiz.Click theEditbutton at the top right of the page.Make sure you are under theDetailstab.In the middle of the page, check-mark the box next to \"Show one question at a time.\"Click the greenSavebutton. This fix will make it easier for Canvas to load the quiz since questions will display one at a time. The problem can worsen if WiFi is being used due to limited bandwidth.'\n",
